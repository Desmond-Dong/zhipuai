## Installation Steps
### Adding Custom Repository to HACS
In Home Assistant's HACS, click the three dots in the top right corner, select "Custom Repositories", and add the following URL:
```bash
https://github.com/knoop7/zhipuai
```

### Adding ZhipuAI Integration
Go to Home Assistant's "Integrations" page, search for and add "ZhipuAI".

### Configuring API Key üîë
On the configuration page, you can get the Key by logging in with your phone number. After obtaining it, simply enter the Key to use it, no additional verification needed.

> **Note**: It's recommended to create a new Key rather than using the system default Key.

### Using Free Models üí°
ZhipuAI defaults to using the free model, which is completely free to use. If interested, you can also choose other paid models to experience richer features.

### Version Compatibility üìÖ
Please ensure your Home Assistant version is not lower than 11.0, as ZhipuAI is primarily developed for the latest version. If you encounter unrecognized entity issues, it's recommended to restart the system or update to the latest version.

### Processing Flow Details

There are three processing mechanisms: 1. Built-in LLM combined with integration for service calls, 2. Custom intent recognition, 3. Diversified AI conversation. LLM API built-in intent and service call recognition is the system's first processing mechanism, specifically for handling direct device control commands, helping the system respond faster to user control needs (millisecond-level operation logic) by combining with the original built-in LLM capabilities.

> Future versions will add more service call mappings to support richer device control capabilities.

#### 2. AI Custom Intent Recognition (Second Priority)

If it cannot be recognized as a specific service call, the system will try to understand the user's broader intent. This layer of processing can handle more complex user needs, supports free language understanding capabilities, and will first let AI process it before enabling tool class call operations, supporting various complex situations to solve user needs. Responsible for converting understood user intents into specific execution actions. Based on semantic analysis results, the system will classify user requests into different processing modules: it could be direct control commands for air conditioners, curtains, TVs and other devices, or management commands for rest, entertainment, work and other scenes, or information queries for weather, news, schedules, etc., as well as intelligent analysis tasks for camera images, sensor data, etc. Through this intelligent distribution mechanism, the system can precisely execute various user needs, providing a smooth smart home experience.

Currently implemented: camera analysis, timed control, timer management, online information search, notification memos, etc.

##### Feature Examples

1. **AI Camera Analysis Intent**
   ```text
   User says: "Help me analyze the front door camera image"
   System will:
   - Call camera service
   - Perform AI image analysis
   - Return analysis results
   ```

2. **AI Notification Control Intent**
   ```text
   User says: "Notify me that today is mom's birthday, need to handle daily payments tomorrow"
   System will:
   - Parse time information
   - Set timer
   - Create reminder notification
   ```

4. **AI Timed Task Management**
   ```text
   User says:
   - "Remind me to close the window in an hour"
   - "Set a bedtime reminder for 8 PM"
   - "Remind me to open the curtains tomorrow at 7 AM"
   System will:
   - Time recognition: Parse specific time points
   - Task extraction: Determine reminder content
   - Timer setting: Create timed tasks
   - Notification management: Set reminder methods

   Please note that you need to generate a timer entity in the system's auxiliary elements, and set the cron expression to 64:00:00 timer, which can be used to modify the execution time for storing timed tasks.
   ```

5. **AI Online Information Search**
   ```text
   Scenario Five: Online Information Search
   User says:
   - "Search online for today's weather forecast"
   - "Help me check yesterday's news"
   - "Search online for recent stock market trends"
   - "Search online for today's sports events"
   - "Internet query for Beijing's traffic conditions today"
   System will:
   - Query type recognition: Determine search topic
   - Time range parsing: Process time-related information
   - Online data acquisition: Access relevant information sources
   - Information organization: Filter and organize search results
   - Smart summary: Generate concise information summary

6. **AI Environmental Device Control**
   ```text
   User says:
   - "Set bedroom temperature to 26 degrees cooling mode"
   - "Increase living room temperature a bit"
   - "Set main bedroom air conditioner fan speed to high"
   - "Open living room curtains halfway"
   - "Close all curtains"
   - "Open main bedroom curtains to 70%"
   System will:
   - Device recognition: Locate specific devices and locations
   - Parameter parsing: Process temperature, mode, fan speed and other parameters
   - State confirmation: Check current device state
   - Execution control: Send precise control commands
   - Feedback confirmation: Verify if operation was successful
   
   Note: System will intelligently determine device type (such as air conditioner, curtains, etc.) and call corresponding control interfaces and parameter settings based on different device types. For percentage-based controls (such as curtain opening/closing), system will automatically perform value conversion and range limiting.

> Future versions will add more AI custom intent recognition to support richer device control capabilities.

#### 3. AI Conversation Response to Various World-Related + System Device State Questions (Third Priority)

As the system's final processing mechanism, when the previous two layers cannot handle user needs, the system will activate AI conversation mode. This layer has language understanding and knowledge processing capabilities, can handle various open-ended questions and complex conversation scenarios. And can analyze home and device-related questions, provide useful suggestions and solutions. All devices in the system have been integrated, more needs users to go to: Configuration - Voice Assistant - Expose New Entities (Expose new entities? Expose supported devices that are not classified as "security devices".) Check, and expose entities, so you can use AI conversation to respond to various world-related questions, has already added air conditioner related attribute values by default, subsequent version updates will continue to add important smart device product attribute values

Secondly, the system will provide coherent conversation responses based on user's conversation history and device states, providing a more fluid interaction experience. You can go to ZhipuAI - Configuration Options - Check History Record Analysis, supports 1-15 days of various related description queries, equivalent to a whole house smart home knowledge base, providing richer conversation response capabilities, better meeting user needs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
> 1. üìÅ Ensure Home Assistant has access permissions for image and video files
> 2. ‚è±Ô∏è Video analysis is recommended to use shorter videos for better results
> 3. ‚ö° Using streaming response can provide better real-time experience but increases system load
> 4. üí´ Image generation service is recommended to start with the free Flash version
> 5. üìä Entity analysis service days should be chosen based on actual needs, avoid analyzing too much historical data
